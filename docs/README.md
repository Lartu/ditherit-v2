# About Dither it!

Dither it! is a web application for dithering images, located at <a href="https://ditherit.com">ditherit.com</a></p>

It was inspired by a [blog post](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/) from a site called Low-tech Magazine about how to reduce the energy usage associated with running websites. One method they discussed was to reduce full color images to dithered images with very few colors. Ensuing comments clarified that there are other, more modern ways to compress images which achieve small file sizes while maintaining color, but we still think it is a fun technique that looks cool and is interesting to learn about.
